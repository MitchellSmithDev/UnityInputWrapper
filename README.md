# Digital Input Wrapper for Unity
A simple and lightweight digital input wrapper for Unity, it is mainly meant for use with 2D games such as fighting games.<br />
It supports up to 32 unique buttons and utilizes simple bitwise to store button states. <br />
This limit shouldn't be an issue as there are up to 26 unique buttons on most modern controllers, while simplifying analog sticks to 4 directional inputs and analog triggers as single buttons.
